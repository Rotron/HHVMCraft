# HHVMCraft

An implementation of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 based off of 
[Truecraft's implementation](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/TrueCraft).

The goal of this project is not to be a fully-functional server,
but rather a proof-of-concept for PHP and HHVM.

### Why?

I don't even know. I thought it'd be cool.
