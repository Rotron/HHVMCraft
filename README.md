# HHVMCraft

A Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Server implemented in PHP, based off of 
[Truecraft's implementation](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/TrueCraft).

The goal of this project is not to be a fully-functional server,
but rather a proof-of-concept for PHP and HHVM.

### Why?

This is a little coding exercise/project, it's not intended to be a serious 
application. :)

As you can tell, this is not the most performant implementation. It's being
developed in a way that's fast to code, and readable.

I am also not a PHP programmer, nor do I know much about socket programming! ;)

So if you have any comments, please feel free to create an issue.
